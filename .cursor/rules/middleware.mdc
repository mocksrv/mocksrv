# Middleware Development Rules

## Files
src/middleware/*.js

## Rules
- Keep middleware functions pure whenever possible
- Chain middleware in a clear, logical order
- Error handling must be explicit, with appropriate status codes
- Use consistent parameter order: (req, res, next)
- Document middleware inputs and outputs clearly
- Asynchronous operations should use await/async pattern
- Log important middleware events at appropriate levels
- Always pass errors to next() rather than handling them within middleware
