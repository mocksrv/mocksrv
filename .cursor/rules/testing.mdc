# Testing Rules

## Files
test/*.test.js

## Rules
- Test filenames should correspond to the module being tested
- Tests should be independent and not rely on other tests
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) for test structure
- Mock external dependencies, particularly network calls
- Test both success paths and error conditions
- Test edge cases comprehensively
- Include integration tests for critical paths
- Keep test code as clear and simple as possible
- Don't use production code in test assertions
