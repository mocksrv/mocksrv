# Store Components Rules

## Files
src/store/*.js

## Rules
- Use immutable data structures where possible
- Implement efficient lookup mechanisms for expectations
- Document matching algorithms clearly
- Include detailed comments for complex matching logic
- Provide validation for all stored expectations
- Implement proper cleanup mechanisms to prevent memory leaks
- Keep store implementations independent of Express middleware
- Follow consistent patterns for store operations (add, find, remove)
- Ensure thread safety for concurrent operations
